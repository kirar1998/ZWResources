 <p>"In an effort to educate people about how to address climate change, student Sage Lenier, a fourth-year conservation and
   resource studies major, won an award for a curriculum she wrote, 'Zero Waste: Solutions for a Sustainable Future,' about 
   the science of modern landfills, the history of “trash” and how we can all reduce personal waste, among other topics. The
   curriculum, which Lenier has taught for the past three semesters in a student-led DeCal course, is a resource that she says
   gives everyone a practical guide on how we can apply existing strategies to re­duce waste. 'Trash is a human invention,' she 
   says. 'There are solutions. We just have to implement them.' Lenier’s long-term goal is to have her course be a regular part
   of the curriculum at all University of California campuses."</p1>
