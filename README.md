## About
“Zero waste” originated as an industrial concept that encourages the redesign of resource life cycles so that all materials are reused. Today, the “zero waste lifestyle” has emerged as many individuals and communities attempt to live more sustainably. In this class, we will tailor the principles of ZW to fit the needs and limitations of the average college student. In addition to learning how a person (or a company, a city, or an industry) goes about reducing their waste, the curriculum contains a variety of both fun and educational topics. Each of these topics are covered for 1-3 weeks: the science of modern landfills, the history of trash, personal waste reduction, industrialized food systems, climate change & politics, sustainable cities & architecture, and cradle-to-cradle design. This course is a comprehensive Everything You Need to Know About the Planet 101, and past students agree that it will invariably change your life and make you see the world differently.

## Summary of Course Content
The core principle of this class is to learn to see every resource as valuable and limited, and how we can use resources more intelligently while living better and happier. This class will be lecture-style, with light weekly readings for homework.
