  <h3>Grading breakdown:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Quizzes (75 points)</li>
Students will be assigned readings and videos when necessary, and answer weekly 
5-question quizzes to verify completion. Each quiz is equally weighted (5 points).
  
<li>Attendance & Participation (75 points)</li>
Show up to first class or get dropped.
Two absences are allowed, with an emailed excuse. Missed material must be made up by
reading through the lecture at home and taking a makeup quiz. Students are expected to
be engaged and attentive during class. Students will be asked to leave class if it is
noted that they are distracted by their electronics; discretion is advised when using phones
and laptops.
  
<li> Final Exam (50 points)</li>
The final exam will be an at-home test. It is not meant to be strenuous, merely an incentive
to learn the material.
</ul>


<h3>Course Materials</h3>
<p1>The unofficial textbook for this class is Living in the Environment by G. Tyler Miller.
This textbook is where a majority of data used in the class are from, and occasionally I will
assign excerpts for reading. No purchases or printing will be required. All readings will be 
provided electronically through PDFs and links.
