  <h1>Grading breakdown:</h1>
<p> ∙ Quizzes (75 points)
Students will be assigned readings and videos when necessary, and answer weekly 5-question quizzes to verify completion. Each quiz is equally weighted (5 points).
∙ Attendance & Participation (75 points)
Show up to first class or get dropped.
Two absences are allowed, with an emailed excuse. Missed material must be made up by reading through the lecture at home and taking a makeup quiz. 
Students are expected to be engaged and attentive during class. 
Students will be asked to leave class if it is noted that they are distracted by their electronics; discretion is advised when using phones and laptops.
∙ Final Exam (50 points)
The final exam will be an at-home test. It is not meant to be strenuous, merely an incentive to learn the material.
The unofficial textbook for this class is Living in the Environment by G. Tyler Miller. This textbook is where a majority of data used in the class are from, and occasionally I will assign excerpts for reading. No purchases or printing will be required. All readings will be provided electronically through PDFs and links.
